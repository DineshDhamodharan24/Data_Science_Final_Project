# Customer Insights and Recommendation System

# About Project  

Develop a comprehensive system that combines classification prediction models, image processing techniques, and text processing for a holistic understanding of customer behavior. Utilize algorithms such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest for customer behavior analysis. Incorporate image processing techniques like EasyOCR and Python Imaging Library (PIL) to extract information and identify objects from images. Implement sentiment analysis using NLTK for text-based data. Finally, build a product recommendation system using NLTK techniques to enhance personalized product suggestions for users based on their behavior and preferences.

# Classification Prediction:

In the classification prediction model, we aim to analyze customer behavior using the following algorithms: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

# Image Processing:

In this module, we process images using techniques such as EasyOCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images, and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to identify and extract objects from images. Additionally, PIL can be used to modify images by changing formats, rotating, and manipulating pixel sizes.
